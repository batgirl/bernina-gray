			<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
			<p>My site will be one page with professional links and will be one page consisting of the following sections:</p>
			<p><strong>Welcome:</strong></p>
			<p>Here will be a brief single line introduction that states my name and role as a Fullstack Web Developer. </p>
			<p><strong>About Me:</strong></p>
			<p>This section will highlight my professional history, with emphasis on my recently acquired technical skills. <br>
				My strengths, passion and a bit of creativity will be implemented as well. I will not have much color <br>
				or major block background color on my homepage. My "Welcome" section will be found near the center of the homepage. <br>
				My "About Me" will be featured with a left page transition and my "Portfolio" section will be featured <br>
				with a homepage down transition. Lastly, my "Contact" info will be found in a left page transition. </p>
			<p><strong>Porfolio:</strong></p>
			<p>I want this section to be somewhat interactive to keep interest, but with minimal instruction. My projects will be <br>
				navigatable with a sort of rotating image carousel effect, with each project in its' own space. It will feature 4 <br>
				examples of my best work.</p>
